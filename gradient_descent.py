# A cost function allows us to express exactly how wrong or "costly" our models is, given our examples.
# One way to compute an overall cost is to take each error value, square it, and add these values together. Multiplying by
# one half will make things simpler down the road. Now that we have a cost, or job is to minimize it. When someone says
# theyâ€™re training a network, what they really mean is that they're minimizing a cost function.
